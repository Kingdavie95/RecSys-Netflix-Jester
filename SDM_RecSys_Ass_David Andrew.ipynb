    "The Netflix Prize dataset is a large dataset of movie ratings that was released by Netflix in 2006. The dataset consists of about 100,000,000 ratings for 17,770 movies given by 480,189 users1. Each rating in the training dataset consists of four entries: user, movie, date of grade, grade. Users and movies are represented with integer IDs, while ratings range from 1 to 51. The goal of the Netflix Prize was to develop a recommendation algorithm that could predict user ratings for movies and TV shows with greater accuracy than Netflixâ€™s existing algorithm, Cinematch2."
